NAME

    sally -- a tool for embedding strings in vector spaces

SYNOPSIS

    sally [-hvV] *config* *input* *output*

DESCRIPTION

    sally is a tool for mapping a set of strings to a set of vectors. This
    mapping is referred to as embedding. The conversion from strings to
    vectors allows for easily applying techniques from statistics, machine
    learning and data mining for analysis of string data. This is the very
    intention of sally.

    sally first loads a set of strings from the *input* source. The
    embedding is then carried out by characterizing the strings using a set
    of features. Depending on the *config* file, these features refer to all
    words contained in the strings, to all byte sequences of length n (byte
    n-grams) or to all word sequences of length n (word n-grams). By
    counting the occurences of the features, sally constructs a vector for
    each string. Each dimension in the vectors corresponds to the occurences
    of a particular feature. The resulting vectors are finally normalized
    and written to the *output* destination.

    A detailed introduction to the embedding of strings is provided by Rieck
    & Laskov, "Linear-time computation of similarity measures for sequential
    data", Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2008.

  Input formats

    dir         The input strings are available as binary files in a
                directory and the name of the directory is given as *input*
                to sally. The suffixes of the files are used as labels for
                the extracted vectors.

    arc         The input strings are available as binary files in a
                compressed archive, such as a zip or tgz archive. The name
                of the archive is given as *input* to sally. The suffixes of
                the files are used as labels for the extracted vectors.

    lines       The input strings are available as lines in a text file. The
                name of the file is given as *input* to sally. No label
                information is supported by this input format. The lines
                need to be seperated by newline and may not contain the NUL
                character.

  Output formats

    libsvm      The feature vectors of the embedded strings are stored in
                libsvm format. The name of the output file is given as
                *output* to sally.

    text        The feature vectors of the embedded strings are stored as a
                plain text using a list of dimensions, features and
                respective values. The name of the output file is given as
                *output* to sally.
