NAME

    sally -- a tool for embedding strings in vector spaces

SYNOPSIS

    sally [-hvV] *config* *input* *output*

DESCRIPTION

    sally is a small tool for mapping a set of strings to a set of vectors.
    This mapping is referred to as embedding and allows for applying
    techniques from statistics, machine learning and data mining for
    analysis of string data. This is the very intention of sally.

    The embedding is carried out incrementally, where sally first loads a
    chunk of strings from *input*, computes the mapping to vectors and then
    writes the chunk of vectors to *output*. The configuration of this
    process, such as the input format, the embedding type and the output
    format, are specified in the file *config*.

  Embedding strings

    sally implements a standard technique for mapping strings to a vector
    space, which is often referred to as *vector space model* or
    *bag-of-words model*. The strings are characterized by a set of
    features, where each feature is associated with one dimension of the
    resulting vector space. sally supports the following types of features:

    words   The strings are partitioned into substrings (words) using a set
            of delimiter characters. Such partitioning is typical for
            natural language processing, where the delimiters are usually
            defined as whitespace and punctation symbols.

    byte n-grams
            The strings are characterized by all possible byte sequences of
            a fixed length n (byte n-grams). These features are frequently
            used if no information about the structure of strings is
            available, such as in bioinformatics or computer security.

    word n-grams
            The strings are characterited by all possible word sequences of
            a fixed length n (word n-grams). These features require the
            definition of a set of delimiters and a length n.

    A detailed introduction to the embedding of strings is provided by Rieck
    & Laskov, "Linear-time computation of similarity measures for sequential
    data", Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2008.

  Input formats

    dir     The input strings are available as binary files in a directory
            and the name of the directory is given as *input* to sally. The
            suffixes of the files are used as labels for the extracted
            vectors.

    arc     The input strings are available as binary files in a compressed
            archive, such as a zip or tgz archive. The name of the archive
            is given as *input* to sally. The suffixes of the files are used
            as labels for the extracted vectors.

    lines   The input strings are available as lines in a text file. The
            name of the file is given as *input* to sally. No label
            information is supported by this input format. The lines need to
            be seperated by newline and may not contain the NUL character.

  Output formats

    libsvm      The feature vectors of the embedded strings are stored in
                libsvm format. The name of the output file is given as
                *output* to sally.

    text        The feature vectors of the embedded strings are stored as a
                plain text using a list of dimensions, features and
                respective values. The name of the output file is given as
                *output* to sally.
